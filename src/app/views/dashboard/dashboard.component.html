        <p>I've always looking for the opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. As a software engineer, 
          I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world.
          As a software engineer I work both on web and mobile platforms. Usually specialized in web and android development. Spend the last 4 years for developing
          skills in ASP.NET, Angularjs and Javascript. Concurrently for the last 2 years developing android applications using Java and have some previous experience 
          on Xamarin.
